# Spectral-Plotter
The software used for obtaining spectra at the 2020 "Beli Brezi" Astronomical Summer Camp

The software requires a set of captured images in the FIT format(preferrably an odd number to reduce the error by taking a median amount) and an image of a lamp with a clearly defined
spectrum for calibrating the wavelength of the spectrum. In the current version it requires manual calibration of the range of y values, in which the spectrum is contained to reduce calculations.
There should also be a given pixel value limit, for which a pixel is considered burned or hit by a cosmic particle.
